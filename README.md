# Skill Based Projects #

## Data Analysis and Visualization:

* __[Airbnb-Listing-EDA](https://github.com/Veto2922/Airbnb-Listing-EDA)__: This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listing data for a particular city. The analysis focuses on factors such as price, availability, location, and property type to identify trends and patterns in the demand for Airbnb listings in the city. The project includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

*  __[Electronics store sales EDA](https://github.com/Veto2922/My-data-analysis-projects/tree/main/project1_Finance%20Problem)__: In this data analysis project, I took on the challenge of exploring 12 months' worth of sales data for an electronics store. The dataset included a vast array of purchase information, including product types, costs, purchase addresses, and more.

*  __[Startup expansion](https://github.com/Veto2922/My-data-analysis-projects/tree/main/project3_startup-expansion)__: In this project, I worked with a comprehensive dataset that provided valuable insights into the dynamics of startup growth, covering key aspects such as location, marketing spending, and revenue. and I made a Dashboard and Report To ensure that the project's insights were easily digestible

* __[tracking Maji Ndogo's water funds (Power BI)](https://github.com/Veto2922/EXPLORE-Al-Integrated-project-Transparency-in-tracking-Maji-Ndogo-s-water-funds)__: Our mission is to communicate with transparency: Where did the money go? We will track the total budget against project completion, monitor teams' performance, and compare budgeted versus actual costs to flag potential corruption, promoting transparency and accountability in addressing Maji Ndogoâ€™s water crisis.

## Machine Learning:

* __[FastML With EDA python package (My own package) ](https://github.com/Veto2922/Fast-Machine-Learning-With-EDA-python-package/tree/main/FastML_With_EDA)__: FastML_With_EDA is a versatile Python package designed to simplify the machine learning pipeline, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing to automated machine learning (AutoML) model training and evaluation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, FastML provides the tools you need to streamline your workflow and make data-driven decisions.
* I also created a [WEB APP](https://github.com/Veto2922/streamlit_app_for_FastML_With_EDA_python_package/tree/main) as GUI for this package 

### Regression
* [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Veto2922/House-Price-Prediction-for-Sync-intern)

--- 

### Classification 
* __[Heart disease prediction (Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Portofolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Classification/Sensor-activity-recognition)__: Create a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has the presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age, sex, cholesterol, etc...).

* __[Detecting a Rock or a Mine (KNN)](https://github.com/Veto2922/Detecting-a-Rock-or-a-Mine-KNN-Project-)__:  Create a machine learning model capable of detecting the difference between a rock or a mine based on the response of the 60 separate sonar frequencies.

* __[Fraud in Wine (SVM))](https://github.com/Veto2922/Fraud-in-Wine-SVM-project-)__:  Develop a machine learning model that attempts to predict if a wine is "Legit" or "Fraud" based on various chemical features.

* __[Customer Churn (Tree Methods Focus))](https://github.com/Veto2922/Supervised-Learning-Capstone-Project---Tree-Methods-Focus/tree/main)__:  Create a model to predict whether or not a customer will Churn. using [Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting]

* __[Text Classification (NLP , Naive_bayes)](https://github.com/Veto2922/Text-Classification-Assessment-NLP-project-)__:  Classifying text reviews  of films as positive or negative

----

### Clustering 
* __[Customer Segmentation for E commerce (KNN , PCA)](https://github.com/Veto2922/Project-Customer-Segmentation-for-E-commerce)__: This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-means clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis). The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior in an e-commerce dataset. Customer segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies and recommendations.
  
* __[Detecting outliers using DBSCAN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdalrahminmohammed/clustering-using-dbscan-with-tasks)__

* __[PCA Manual Implementation](https://github.com/Veto2922/PCA-Manual-Implementation)__: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. This project provides step-by-step instructions for implementing PCA.
